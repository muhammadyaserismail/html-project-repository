Artificial intelligence aims to create smart machines in everyday activities. Also, artificial intelligence in our daily life applies to machines that are easily programmed to perform specific tasks. They include watches, phones, and facial recognition technology. Although the facial recognition devices can distinguish faces elaborately at a higher speed than humans, it does not distinguish between cars, houses and other physical objects. It is specifically programmed to know the faces of people. Also, AI continues to thrive and might be fitted almost in all electronic devices in the future.
